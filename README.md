## My process

### Built with

- Java 
- Java Swing

### What I learned

I learned how to program a simple program in Java for the first time. I learned how to work with Java Swing to create graphical user interfaces as well as
implementing methods. I also learn't how to get values of comboBoxes and textField and manipulate them to process data. Finally i learned how to convert
the different data types in java and work with single data types which was really amazing.


### Continued development

I would like to continue learning Java to the fullest by creating more application and learn different algorithms. But most importantly i want to learn to work with web servers for my next project in Java.
